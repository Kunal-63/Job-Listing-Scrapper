And now they’re coming together—Avengers-style—to build the next big category defining product.\n\nWe can’t tell you exactly what we are building yet (shhh), but we can tell you this: It is a mobile-first product designed to bring the power of Generative AI into the daily lives of consumers in a way that feels like magic, not just \"tech.\"\n\nWe are looking for a Product Designer who is obsessed with Mobile UX, loves the chaos of 0-to-1 building, and wants to design interfaces for intelligence, not just data.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mission\n\nMost AI products today feel like \"tools.\" We want to build a \"companion.\"\n\nWe are moving beyond simple chatbots. We are designing a consumer experience that anticipates needs and simplifies complex workflows. Your job is to make the sophisticated AI backend feel invisible, intuitive, and delightful on a mobile screen.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll Do (The 0 to 1 Journey)\n\nOwn the Mobile Experience: This is a hard requirement. You aren’t shrinking a desktop site to mobile; you are designing natively for iOS/Android. You think in gestures, haptics, thumb zones, and bottom sheets.\nDefine AI Interaction Patterns: How does a user interact with an AI that \"thinks\"? You will design the affordances, loading states, and feedback loops that build trust between the human and the AI.\nPrototype at Warp Speed: In the early days, speed is survival. You will turn abstract ideas into tangible wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes (Figma) to test hypotheses with the founders.\nCollaborate with the Best: You will work directly with founders who have scaled products and strategies at the highest levels. You will need to defend your design decisions with logic and user empathy.\n\n\n\n\nWho You Are\n\nThe Experience: You have 3-6 years of product design experience, with a heavy portfolio focus on Mobile Consumer Apps. (SaaS dashboards are great, but we need someone who understands consumer psychology).\nThe Tooling: You breathe Figma. You are organized with your design systems but flexible enough to break the rules when innovation requires it.\nThe \"AI\" Curiosity: You don’t just design static screens; you are curious about how GenAI works and how to design for dynamic content.\nThe Mindset: You are comfortable with ambiguity. \"Stealth mode\" means requirements change, pivots happen, and you need to be resilient and adaptable.\n\n\n\n\nWhy You Should Join\n\nThe Pedigree: Work alongside alumni from IIT Delhi, from top notch consulting and tech firms. This is a masterclass in high-performance execution.\nThe Impact: You are not Employee #500. You are a founding designer. Your fingerprints will be on the DNA of this product forever.\nThe Compensation: We value top talent. Offering a competitive range of ₹24 - 30 LPA.\n\n\n\n\nThe Selection Process\n\nWe know talented designers are busy. We’ve designed a streamlined process that respects your time while allowing your skills to shine.\n\nApplication & The \"Sprint\": Fill out the form. Along with attaching your CV and Portfolio, the form includes a rapid-fire Product Critique: The Perplexity Deep-Dive: Spend some time with the Perplexity mobile app. Identify three specific UX improvements or feature additions that would significantly enhance its stickiness or usability as a daily companion.We aren't looking for visual nitpicks; we want to see how you think about interaction models and user psychology. Submit 3 concise bullet points only.\nPortfolio Walkthrough and : Show what you have done and be ready for some grilling :) \nThe Discussion: Deep dive interview with the founders.\n\n\n\n\nReady to build the future of Consumer AI?",
